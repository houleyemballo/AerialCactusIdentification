Human activity has a large impact on environmental health, and tracking that impact is critical. Activities like logging, mining, and agriculture can destroy the functioning of natural areas.  In each ecosystem, there are plants and animals that have an outsized impact on the healthy balance found in the region. These keystone species are critical to the survival of many other species in the region. Performing an accurate account of the species present can give insight into the health of a given area, and can help pinpoint areas that are in special need of immediate restoration efforts.

The first step in this project is to use drone footage to identify critical, or keystone species in the images. The initial images are from the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley, a semi-arid zone in southern Mexico. This area was chosen because of its wide biodiversity and the importance that the ecology plays in the health of the region. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018 in an effort to protect the area. Despite this protection, human activity is still impacting the health of the region. \n\nOur work focuses on columnar cactus recognition as they are a keystone species in the region. Our dataset includes over 16,000 RGB images representing an area of over 10,000 km^2. The images were taken by a DJI Phantom 3 Advanced drone flying at 100m. The images were manually identified and marked. \n\nCare must be taken to ensure that images labeled as having cactus present are accurate. While it would cause a waste of labor to move to intervene in an area that was incorrectly marked as not having cacti, it would be more problematic to miss impacted areas all together. This would mean areas that are in need of restoration would go unnoticed. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Import Relevant Libraries\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport

Setting 'same' to padding extends the area in which CNN processes an image. We also make sure to set our input shape. Our initial filter is set in this layer which determines the number of filters from which the CNN will learn.\n\nWe then include a MaxPooling2D layer. This operation is putting a 2D filter over each channel and summarising the features covered by the filter. This is performing downsampling on our photos, specifically on the height and width of the spatial dimensions.\n\nWe then flatten our matrix down to a single long array before putting it through two more Dense layers.\n\nIn compiling our model we are using an adam optimizer with a set learning rate of .01. Additionally, we have put in an early stop in this model. Early stop will make sure to stop the model learning at a point where it seems there are no more improvements to be made on model function.\n\nWe are giving the next models more epochs to run through to evaluate performance over more iterations. We can set the epoch to a high number, and trust that the early stop will end the model training when no improvements are being made.
