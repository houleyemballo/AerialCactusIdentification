Human activity has a large impact on environmental health, and tracking that impact is critical. Activities like logging, mining, and agriculture can destroy the functioning of natural areas.  In each ecosystem, there are plants and animals that have an outsized impact on the healthy balance found in the region. These keystone species are critical to the survival of many other species in the region. Performing an accurate account of the species present can give insight into the health of a given area, and can help pinpoint areas that are in special need of immediate restoration efforts. \n\nFor an in depth look into the original research, please reference the paper found [here.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1574954119300895?via%3Dihub)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Business Understanding","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://live.staticflickr.com/2251/5758564003_70a47ae0eb.jpg)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[](https://live.staticflickr.com/5181/5758564919_8fb1db830e_b.jpg)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The Mexican Government has partnered with the VIGIA project, which aims to create an autonomous surveillance system for monitoring the ecological health of protected natural areas. The first step in this project is to use drone footage to identify critical, or keystone species in the images. The initial images are from the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley, a semi-arid zone in southern Mexico. This area was chosen because of its wide biodiversity and the importance that the ecology plays in the health of the region. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2018 in an effort to protect the area. Despite this protection, human activity is still impacting the health of the region. \n\n## Ecological Understanding\n\nOur work focuses on columnar cactus recognition as they are a keystone species in the region. A keystone species is defined as an organism that helps to hold the system together. Without this species, the ecosystem would look different and its functions would shift dramatically. Some ecosystems may not be able to adapt to environmental changes if the keystone species disappears. With the backbone of the area gone, there is room for invasive species to take over and dramatically shift the ecosystem in an unhealthy direction. \n\nIn the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán Valley, some of the richest biodiversity in North America is found. Due to the nearby mountains, the valley only receives annual precipitations of 400 to 800mm. A central feature in this diverse region is the columnar cactus. It provides essential habitat for many species of animals. The columnar cactus also functions to reduce erosion in the area and helps to maintain vital water in the landscape. As the cactus disappears, many other species of birds, lizards, mammals, and insects lose their habitat and food and water source. Research has also found the columnar cactus provides important features in the landscape that provides ideal germination grounds for many other species of plants endemic to the region.\n\nHuman activity has reduced the healthy land in the valley by 14.69 percent since the year 2000. Agricultural activities, along with mining and deforestation are impacting the health of the region. Because of the large size of the site, it is nearly impossible to monitor the entire area, leaving many remote spaces vulnerable to degradation.\n\nFor many years, aerial vehicles like small airplanes and helicopters have been used to monitor large natural areas. The cost for using these vehicles is high, which limits the frequency of use. As drones have become easier to access and cheap to use, they can be applied to unique problems like natural ecosystem monitoring. They can be used for frequently, allowing for more images to be collected and processed for a deeper understanding of the region.\n\n\n# False Negatives and Positives \n\nIn our model, we will be assessing if an image has a columnar cactus present or not. A false negative is an image that has a cactus present, but is incorrectly labeled as not holding a cactus. A false positive is an image that is predicted to have a cactus present when it does not.\n\nCare must be taken to ensure that images labeled as having cactus present are accurate. While it would cause a waste of labor to move to intervene in an area that was incorrectly marked as not having cacti, it would be more problematic to miss degraded areas with no cactus all together. This would mean areas that are in need of restoration would go unnoticed.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Import Relevant Libraries\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.express as px\n%matplotlib inline\nimport keras\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator, array_to_img, img_to_array, load_img\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Input, LSTM, AveragePooling2D\nfrom keras.datasets import mnist\nfrom keras import regularizers, initializers, optimizers\nimport os\nimport datetime\nfrom keras.wrappers.scikit_learn import KerasRegressor\nfrom tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping\nfrom sklearn.metrics import plot_confusion_matrix\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, plot_confusion_matrix\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport gc\nfrom timeit import default_timer as timer\nimport tensorflow as tf\npd.set_option('display.float_format', lambda x: '%.1f' % x)\nos.environ['KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK']='True' #This prevents kernel shut down due to xgboost conflict\nfrom tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image\nimport zipfile\nimport random\nimport cv2\nfrom tensorflow import keras\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, Dense, Flatten, Dropout, Activation\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization, Reshape, MaxPooling2D, GlobalAveragePooling2D\nfrom tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, ReduceLROnPlateau\nimport pydot\nimport graphviz\nfrom tensorflow.keras.utils import plot_model\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n#Take a look at the available data\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input/aerial-cactus-identification/\"))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-09T04:31:36.856392Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-09T04:31:36.856893Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-09T04:31:45.091129Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-09T04:31:36.856832Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-09T04:31:45.090279Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\ndef plot_performance(hist,model):\n    \"\"\" Returns 5 pairs of plots comparing Training and Validation data. \n    The first column is autoscaled.

It would be an effective tool for the Mexican Government to begin their environmental site assessments using drones. I have iterated through many different models and I have also tried out a pre-trained Resnet model. The final model was chosen because it is simple, and also offers the highest performance. It is a good example of why added complexity does not always yield better results. \n\nWhile the results are good, they are not perfect. I do believe with further work it would be possible to have the model performing with 100% accuracy and %100 precision. I would like to move forward with a different type of activation layer to assess improvements. Pulling in other pre-trained models would also show if other types of pre-trained models show improvements that Resnet does not. \n\nOverall, a precision score of %99.66 and an overall accuracy of  means that we can identify areas that do not have our keystone species with confidence.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Application of the Model\n\nOur model can be used for a wide variety of functions. First, it will be a large asset in resource prioritization. The care takers of the valley can perform drone flights over the entirety of the valley much faster than researchers could walk the space. The resulting images would be consistent, and areas lacking cacti can accurately be identified, helping pinpoint spaces for restoration work. This will cut down on any time wasted searching for new sites to amend. The use of a drone also helps monitor hard to reach areas. Finally, the use of a drone for monitoring is one of the least invasive ways to monitor natural areas. It reduces the need for automotive traffic and foot traffic through the region. This also helps with safety as researchers will not have to spend large amounts of time in remote areas in the field. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Next Steps","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Species classification expansion \n\nMoving forward, we would like to expand our model to recognize and classify other critical plant and animal species in the region. This would allow the model to give a complete ecological health account of the region. In the Tehuacán-Cuicatlán region, 70% of worldwide flora communities are represented with over 3,000 species of vascular plants of which %10 are endemic to the valley. By adding more species to our classification model, we can offer frequent drone flights to monitor the presence of more critical species in the area. Other species of critical import can be prioritized. There are 38 threatened species endemic to the region that could potentially be prioritized in further modeling. \n\n\n### Species Count \n\nTo make the model more robust, adding in the capacity to estimate the number of target species present in an image would help with any environmental site assessment. While it is useful to identify pieces of land with cacti present, it would be more useful to know the amount in an area. As our model stands now, a piece of land with a single cactus would be classified in the same category as a piece of land with 1500 cacti present. Adding the capacity for count would allow us to further prioritize land in need of remediation efforts. \n\n### Specific Human Impact Assessment \n\nRight now, our model is looking for the lack of certain critical plant species to evaluate the consequences of human impact. A better solution would be to train a model to specifically look for the hallmarks of negative human activity in sensitive areas like evidence of logging, mining, or agriculture. In images that are classified as having no cactus present, it would be useful to further classify them into human impact categories.
